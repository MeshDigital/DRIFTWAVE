---

### Phase 3C: Advanced Queue Orchestration - COMPLETE
**Impact**: Solves "Traffic Jam" issues where large imports block single downloads.
- **Multi-Lane Priority Engine**:
  - **Lane A (Express)**: Priority 0 (2 guaranteed slots).
  - **Lane B (Standard)**: Priority 1 (2 max slots).
  - **Lane C (Background)**: Priority 10+ (Background fill).
- **Preemption Logic**: High priority downloads automatically pause lowest-priority active tasks.
- **Persistence**: Priority levels (even single-track overrides) are persisted to DB to survive restarts.
- **Lazy Hydration (Waiting Room)**: 
  - Only hydrates top 100 pending tracks to RAM.
  - Automatic DB refill when buffer is low.
  - Reduces memory usage for 2000+ track queues.
- **Project Prioritization**: "VIP Pass" logic to bump entire playlists to Priority 0.

## 🐛 Known Issues (Backlog)

### High Priority
- **UI Scalability**: Large playlists cause UI stuttering (Phase 6C TreeDataGrid required).
- **N+1 Queries**: Some UI views trigger redundant database fetches.
- **Soft Deletes**: Deleting projects is currently destructive (needs Audit Trail).

### Medium Priority
- **Duplicate Detection**: Batch imports sometimes miss duplicates within the same batch.
- **Drag-and-Drop**: Positioning issues on high-DPI displays.
